# Coding Best Practice

Here is a list of common best practices you should consider when you are coding.

* When creating a new branch to start a new feature, add the story number associated to that branch name  
> **_NOTE:_** feature/AT0-05_add_coding_best_practice
* Commit early and often - using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
> **_NOTE:_** 'feat: adding in the section on best practices [ATO-05]'
* Try to avoid using abbreviations in your code - spell things out and make sure your variable names make sense for what is being stored in them
* Wait until all pull request comments are resolved before you merge your code
* Clean up your branches on both your remote and local
