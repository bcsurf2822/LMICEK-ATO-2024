# Deployment

Here is a list of common best practices you should consider when you are deploying your code.

* Make sure whatever your using for deployment, can be automated but also triggered manually 
* Pay attention to your logs
* Use a file that can run your deployment steps so that it can be version controlled alongside your code
* Keep steps lean - don't try to cram everything into one step
* Use consistent and meaningful naming conventions
